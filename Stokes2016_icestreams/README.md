# Laurentide ice sheet, ice-stream timing

The original ice-stream outlines are defined by Margold et al. (2015) - see Margold2015_icestream. Here each ice stream is assigned an age to track when they occurred. So, this can be used with the Margold2015 dataset to produce masks of ice streams for different time periods.

For now, the ice streams pertaining to the LGM were extracted and then used to generate a new mask within the Margold2015_icestream workflow.

## Steps

1. Download the Source data to Fig. 1, which is an Excel file.

2. Open the Excel file and write in a text file the numbers of the streams associated with the age of the LGM (21.8 kyr ago).

3. Copy the text file to the Margold2015_icestream folder.
